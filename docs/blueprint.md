# **App Name**: JSON Data Viewer

## Core Features:

- Data Fetching: Fetch and display JSON data from a specified URL. Defaults to https://report-flame.vercel.app/omo_cashflow.json
- Data Table Display: Render JSON data in a tabular format with sortable columns.
- Advanced Search: Implement advanced search functionality to filter data based on multiple criteria. Include a tool so the app can assess the criteria to decide when or if to display results.
- Chart Generation (AI): Provide the option to generate charts using AI insights from the data.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep purple (#673AB7) for a modern, tech-oriented feel.
- Background color: Light lavender (#EDE7F6) to ensure readability and a calm interface.
- Accent color: Electric purple (#BB86FC) to highlight interactive elements and call-to-actions.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif, will lend a modern, machined, objective look that suits the presentation of structured data.
- Use a set of simple, line-based icons to represent different data types and actions (e.g., search, sort, filter).
- Maintain a clean, organized layout with clear visual hierarchy to make data easily accessible.
- Incorporate subtle animations for loading data, search transitions, and chart updates.
